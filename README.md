# TouchBarScreenshotter

This is a very simple background app to save a screenshot of the currently active Touch Bar to the Desktop. It floats as an overlay over all apps, and has a single button that will save a screenshot of the Touch Bar UI with no chrome. This can be perfomed on Macs with or without a physical Touch Bar, and is great for marketing shots.

Requires macOS 10.12.1 (16B2657) or higher. This build is not the release build of macOS 10.12.1, but can be downloaded from the developer portal.
